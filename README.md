# ReverQuest

ReverQuest is a web application which aims at improving the overall experience of motorcycle riders by suggesting scenic routes to drivers. We also incorporate a social networking aspect within the app, where riders could look at the rides taken by their friends. 

## Technology Used
Built using Flask, Angular JS, MySQL and MapQuest API. 

This app was developed at HackCU as part of the challenge set by Rever.
